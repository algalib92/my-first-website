            <h3>Graphic Design is about Molding the User Experience Visually </h3>
            <p>Graphic design is an ancient craft, dating back past Egyptian hieroglyphs to at least 17,000-year-old

                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
